# Presentation: Motivation and use (ARTHUR)
  
Here are some questions to ask yourself when you are interested in coding and/or using functions:
  
::: {.center data-latex=""}
$${\color{red}Why? \space what \space do \space you \space need? }$$
      &rarr; If you need to tailor some existing functions, if you are going to use them many times. If you want to save time and have a way to standardize your coding with existing one.
  
  
$${\color{orange}Who \space is \space it \space for?}$$
      &rarr; Are the changes or the created function of any use for other coders or anyone working in similar field?
  
$${\color{gold}Where?}$$ 
      &rarr; do you need a place to share code and make it available. github is an option. CRAN make it more accessible.
  
$${\color{green}How?}$$ 
      &rarr; We are going to dig into the steps of creating a package!
:::

Here we go beyond the agreed knowledge that everyone knows broadly what is a package and how to install new packages: using `install.packages("x")` and then `library(X)`.
  
<br><br><br><br>


  
One of the main principles in good coding practice is 'do not repeat yourself'. There are some options to achieve these goal. One of them is to create a loop, when your task is only to repeat a procedure with different input. Other option is to create a custom function, which allow you to modify predefined places of your code using arguments. 
  
When we are creating a analysis or cleaning data it could be useful to write a function and let it in a separated file. Then, you only need to add a `source()` in your script to load your custom function in the R environment and you are able use it across your script. Using this approach will make your code more readable and tidy, because instead of several lines of code to do a step of your analysis, you now have only few lines of code using your custom function. Moreover, you can use it several times in your script without need to copy and paste your code and change few characters. 
  
Therefore, for a project you are working, you can create as much functions you need, and load it your scripts using the `source()` function. However, if you have created a set of functions that could be useful in other projects or for other people, it could be nice to create an R package. Which could also let your coding more susceptible to errors. 
  
  

## Pros and cons to create a package
Since you have some custom functions, you might wonder if it is a good idea to create a package. 
  
Pros:   
- Easy access to functions that you've created (it is easier to add a `library()` call in your script than a `source()`)  
- Your functions have help pages
- Your functions could be used by others
- Users could give feedback to your function 
  
Cons:  
- Could be time consuming to create and maintain a package
- Users could give feedback to your functions (bugs)

# Package structure:  (Emy)
## What compose the R package?
  
* DESCRIPTION file: This is the metadata for the package. It contains:
  + Package name
  + Title and description
  + Authors
  + Dependencies (depends, imports, suggests)
  + Licensing
  + Version number
  + Bug report location, and so on
  
* R/ directory for R files that contain your functions
  
* NAMESPACE file which specifies the function that compose your package and what imports functions from othe rpacages are needed.
  
These are created using:  `usethis::create_package()`
  
* Other optional information such as data etc..
  
   
The Description file is a simple file format called DCF, the Debian control format. It is created using `usethis::create_package("mypackage")`.
For example, we will set up the different fields:

:::{.blackbox data-latex=""}
Package: Gradients

Title: Creates a gradient image and modify it. *only one line*

Version: 0.0.0.9000 *consider carefully the version*

Authors@R: 
    person("First", "Last", , "first.last@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))

Description: Gradients creates an customized image that display a gradient. Other 
functionalities include modifying the radient direction or stepness as well as transposing directly the gradient image. *What the package does (one paragraph)*

License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a
    license

Encoding: UTF-8

Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)

RoxygenNote: 7.2.3

## Documentation
  
A good package needs good documentation, for that purpose we already talked about the description file above. Another important document is the vignette that can be created using: `usethis::use_vignette("my-vignette")`. The vignette is more informative of the workflow and the purpose of your functions.

  
### User friendly documentation:  
It is helpful to use the *roxygen2* package to manually adapt the documentation files. 
Roxygen comment lines always start with #'. and all the roxygen2 comments preceding a function are collectively called a block. Blocks are broken up by tags, which look like @tagName tagValue. A block can contain text before the first tag which is called the introduction. By default, each block generates a single documentation topic, i.e. a single .Rd file6 in the man/ directory.
Some common tag include: @params, @returns, @description, @seealso, @examples, and @export

:::{.blackbox data-latex=""}
#' @params x,y integer values.  
#'  
#' @returns An object of type image.  
#'  
#' @description  
#'  
#' @seealso  
#'   [WiggleImage()] to modify the gradients direction and steepness.  
#'   [TransposeImage] to transpose the image.  
#'  
#' @examples  
#'   Rast2 = CreateGradient(x=-30, y=80)  
#'   plot(Rast2)

## R code :   
Let's consider few function for raster and image modification. First, our new functions and worflow will depend on other packages that we need to load:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(spatstat)
library(lattice)
```

Next, we want to create an image that display a gradient along the area of interest. Thus set the coordinates of our gridded area (resolution) and define a function which will evaluate the values $v1$ across our space. The last step is to create the image using `as.im()`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(113)
XY = expand.grid(seq(0, 100, 1), seq(0, 100, 1))
X = XY[,1]
Y = XY[,2]

v1 = (X - 30)^2 + (Y + 80)^2 - 0.5*X*Y
v1 = -1*scale(v1)

raster.im = as.im(data.frame(x = X, y = Y, z = v1))
plot(raster.im)

```


These different steps can be combined in a function, where we can play with $x$ and $y$ to establish a different gradient. Let's call this function `CreateGradient`
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### create image/raster
CreateGradient = function(x, y){

  XY = expand.grid(seq(0, 100, 1), seq(0, 100, 1))
  X = XY[,1]
  Y = XY[,2]
  
  v1 = (X - x)^2 + (Y + y)^2 - 0.5*X*Y
  v1 = -1*scale(v1)
  
  raster.im = as.im(data.frame(x = X, y = Y, z = v1))
  #plot(raster.im)
  
  return(raster.im)
}

Rast1 = CreateGradient(x=30, y=80)
plot(Rast1)
```

If we change the value of $x$ and $y$, we see the gradient can have a different direction.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Rast2 = CreateGradient(x=-30, y=80)
plot(Rast2)
```
However, we could also want to change the gradient based on the same initial image. For eample we can create a function able to transpose the image we see according to an horizontal axis. Let's call this function `TransposeImage`:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
TransposeImage = function(Rast){
  
  mat1 <- apply(Rast$v, 2, rev)
  rast.trasnp = as.im(mat1)

  return(rast.trasnp)
}

Rast2.tr = TransposeImage(Rast2)
plot(Rast2.tr)
```
Finally, we can create a function that modifies the shape of the gradient by playing with $x$ and $y$ input values in the function `WiggleImage`:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
WiggleImage = function(Rast, x, y){
  Rast.w = Rast
  
  XY = expand.grid(seq(0, 100, 1), seq(0, 100, 1))
  X = XY[,1]
  Y = XY[,2]
  
  Rast.w$v = Rast.w$v + x*X + y*Y
  
  return(Rast.w)
}

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
Rast_change = WiggleImage(Rast = Rast1, x = -0.1, y = 0.6)
plot(Rast_change)

Rast_change2 = WiggleImage(Rast = Rast1, x = 1, y = -10)
plot(Rast_change2)
```

Now, we have 3 functions to create our package! Let's call it `Gradients`.
The function created can be organize into one or multiple files if needed.

# Creation and Maintenance (Arthur)

Main packages needed for package development:
* devtools: Creation - building o the package
* usethis: help with documentation, testing and broadcast
* roxygen2: help with the documentation set up
* pkgdown:
* testthat: testing

! You also need a system builder ! Make sure Rtools is installed which is done differently depending on your system (windows, MacOS, Linux).

FOR ARTHUR: should we explain this different concept:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("install-load.png")
```


<br><br><br><br>

## Step by step
Whole R package development workflow:

* `available::available("pkgname")` # check if package name is available (if planning to publish publicly)
* `usethis::create_package("pkgname")` # create the package
* `usethis::use_git()` # set up version control
* `usethis::use_github()` # optional
* `usethis::use_r("myfile")` # creating new R file in the R/ directory
* `usethis::use_data_raw()` # if adding data
* `devtools::load_all()` # try it out in the console
* `usethis::use_package("import-pkgname")` # add package to import (or depends or suggests)

Documentations:

* `usethis::use_package_doc()` # add package documentation
* `usethis::use_pipe()` # if you want to add %>% from `magrittr`
* `usethis::use_vignette("vignette-name")` # add vignette
* `usethis::use_test()` # make test file for active R file

Write some test

* `devtools::test_active_file()` # test active file
* `devtools::test()` # test whole package
* `devtools::build()` # build vignettes
* `devtools::install()` # to install package
* `devtools::check()` # to build and check a package 
* `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` # to add a README Rmd file
* `styler::style_pkg()` # optional (commit first, then review changes carefully)
* `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()` # for setting up pkgdown website on github
* `usethis::use_pkgdown()` if not using github pages
